                    <p style="text-indent:22px;">Attention is directed automatically to locations in the visual field, based on what is salient to the organism, in order to ensure rapid processing of new and important stimuli. In perception, there are many different feature dimensions of the visual field that need to be processed, including color, motion, and size. Itti, Koch & Neibur (1998) argued that salience occurs due to contrast in single dimensions. For example, if the majority of the visual field is gray, but one area is red, the red area will be salient and draw the organism's attention. This color salience will compete with salience in other dimensions, for instance motion, to determine the orientating of attention.</p>

                    <p style="text-indent:22px;">Processing the dimensions of visual perception is distributed across different areas of the brain (Zeki, 1976). After processing, these features need to be combined into coherent percepts. Using a series of 9 experiments, Treisman and Gelade (1980) showed that when the organism attends to some location, the visual dimensions at that location are bound to form a percept. Therefore, before a stimulus is attended to, its dimensions (colors, texture, shape, etc.) are "free floating," and can be misattributed to other unattended objects in the surround. This theory opposes the Gestalt psychological view that percepts are decomposed into features <em>a posteriori</em>. Thus, it has implications for studies that assume a Gestalt view of object identification, such as those that assume stimuli can be identified preattentively. Treisman and Gelade (1980) used visual search tasks to demonstrate this phenomenon. Using a 2 x 3 repeated measures design, the researchers found that response times increased with the number of distractors in the search field, but only when targets contained two or more dimensions. This suggests that when search targets contained more than one dimension, subjects needed to attend to each item in the search field until the target was found, which increased search time. This supports the hypothesis that attention is required to bind features in object recognition. Since attention is required to bind conjunctions of features, the view of Treisman and Gelade (1980) implies that whole objects cannot cause salience before the organism attends to it. This supports the Itti, Koch and Neibur\'s (1998) hypothesis that attention is driven by the salience of single dimensions.</p>
